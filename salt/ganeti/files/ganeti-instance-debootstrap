# ganeti-instance-debootstrap defaults file

# if you want to change from the default of installing debian stable
# on the next instance, customize this file before the instance
# installation

# PROXY: if non-null, use this as an http(s)-proxy in order to speed
# up non-cached installs or provide internet access if not directly
# possible; not that if not set, debootstrap might still use a
# system-wide proxy setting if it is exported in the ganeti-noded
# daemon environment (but the node daemon environment is cleaned up
# and not exported starting with Ganeti 2.5)
# PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:3128/"

# MIRROR: do not customize MIRROR if you want to be able to install
# both debian and ubuntu, since they have different defaults; or
# customize it before each install
MIRROR="http://http.debian.net/debian"

# ARCH: define ARCH only if you want a different architecture than the
# current one; the known use case is to install a 32-bit instance on a
# 64-bit node; choose either "i386" or "amd64":
ARCH="amd64"

# SUITE: change suite to any of the ones supported by deboostrap; this
# could be unstable, etch, etc.:
SUITE="jessie"

# EXTRA_PKGS: depending on the suite and architecture you are using, different
# extra packages are needed for different hypervisors. For example:
#
# Xen, for squeeze i386:
# EXTRA_PKGS="linux-image-xen-686,libc6-xen"
# Xen, for wheezy i386:
# EXTRA_PKGS="libc6-xen"
# Xen, for squeeze amd64:
# EXTRA_PKGS="linux-image-xen-amd64"
# KVM, for squeeze/wheezy i386:
# EXTRA_PKGS="acpi-support-base,console-tools,udev,linux-image-686"
# KVM, for squeeze/wheezy amd64:
EXTRA_PKGS="acpi-support-base,udev,linux-image-amd64,vim-nox,htop,strace,lsof,less"

# COMPONENTS: if defined, overrides the default debootstrap components
# ("main"); when not defined, it will not passed to debootstrap
# Debian example:
COMPONENTS="main,contrib,non-free"
# Ubuntu example:
# COMPONENTS="main,universe"
# Default:
# COMPONENTS=""

# CUSTOMIZE_DIR: a directory containing scripts to customize the installation.
# The scripts are executed using run-parts
# By default /etc/ganeti/instance-debootstrap/hooks
# CUSTOMIZE_DIR="/etc/ganeti/instance-debootstrap/hooks"

# GENERATE_CACHE: if set to yes (the default), create new cache files;
# any other value will disable the generation of cache files (but they
# will still be used if they exist)
GENERATE_CACHE="yes"

# CLEAN_CACHE: should be set to the number of days after which to
# clean the cache; the default is 14 (two weeks); to disable cache
# cleaning, set it to an empty value ("")
CLEAN_CACHE="14"

# PARTITION_STYLE: whether and how the target device should be partitioned.
# Allowed values:
# 'none': just format the device, but don't partition it
# 'msdos': install an msdos partition table on the device, with a single
#          partition on it
# (more styles may be added in the future)
# The default is "msdos" from ganeti 2.0 onwards, but none if installing under
# Ganeti 1.2 (os api version 5)
PARTITION_STYLE="none"

# PARTITION_ALIGNMENT: the alignment of the partitions in sectors
# (512B); this defaults to 1MiB to give grub enough space for
# embedding and for better alignment with modern media (HDDs and
# SSDs), feel free to increase it if your media has even bigger
# allocation blocks
# PARTITION_ALIGNMENT=2048
